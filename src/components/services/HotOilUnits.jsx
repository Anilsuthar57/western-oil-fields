        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-7 text-lg mb-4">
          Our Hot Oil Units are engineered for precision heat transfer and are essential for well servicing and pipeline maintenance operations. These units are capable of delivering consistent heat at high temperatures, ensuring smooth and safe flow within your systems.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-7 text-lg mb-4">
          Designed for rugged environments, each unit is built on a heavy-duty skid or trailer, providing mobility and structural stability in the most demanding conditions. The heating systems are powered by advanced burner technology with automated control systems for accurate temperature regulation.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-7 text-lg mb-4">
          Our units come equipped with integrated circulation pumps, insulated tanks, and high-capacity hose reels. This setup allows for quick deployment and efficient heat transfer, minimizing downtime during operations.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-7 text-lg mb-4">
          We prioritize safety with built-in emergency shutoffs, flame arrestors, pressure-relief valves, and high-temp limit switches. The control panel provides real-time diagnostics, system alerts, and remote operation capabilities.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-7 text-lg mb-4">
          With low-emission combustion systems and energy-efficient designs, our hot oil units meet international environmental standards while reducing fuel consumption.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-7 text-lg mb-4">
          These units are widely used in applications like heating oil lines, cleaning paraffin buildup, frac water heating, and other critical thermal fluid operations in upstream oil and gas fields.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-7 text-lg mb-4">
          Our technical specialists are available for custom configuration, commissioning, and training support to ensure that every deployment meets the exact operational needs of your project.
